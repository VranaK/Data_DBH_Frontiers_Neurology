**Abstract**

**Background:** Genetics play an important role in both the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the dopaminergic system is central to the key neurochemical pathology and current therapeutic strategies for PD, impairment of the noradrenergic system is an additional contributor that has not yet been fully explored. Noradrenergic neuron loss in the locus coeruleus has been documented in PD patients, a change that occurs earlier and to a greater extent than the loss of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) cells. Dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) is present in the synaptic vesicles of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons and is responsible for converting DA to norepinephrine (NE). Gandiven the potential role of DβH in neurological conditions, it may, therefore, be an important disease-causing or disease-modifying gene.

**Methods:** In this study, we assessed a cohort of patients diagnosed with PD (n=106) and age-matched controls (n=74) for genetic variants in the DβH gene. A total of 34 exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were assessed using the NINDS NeuroX platform , as well as TaqMan genotyping.

**Results:** We found that a single polymorphism, Arg549Cys (rs6271), was over-represented in PD patients compared to controls, with an odds ratio of 3.9 (p=0.0056). This polymorphism is located in a highly conserved tetramerization domain that is thought to be important for the maintenance of proper DβH function. Interestingly, this polymorphism was not included in the NINDS NeuroX anlysis platform. We, therefore, examined the function and availability of the protein in the serum of a subset of matched PD and control subjects representing different genotypes of the DβH Arg549Cys SNP. Both controls and PD patients heterozygous for Arg549Cys had lower circulating DβH protein with higher levels of intrinsic enzyme activity.

**Conclusions:** The current case-control study supports the role of sympathetic and noradrenergic signaling in the pathogenesis of PD. Results suggest that the over-representation of rs6271 Arg549Cys SNP in PD patients suggests a potential novel contributor to the disease and the implications of this SNP in the development and progression of PD warrant further study.

NeuroX Genotyping Data Acquisition and Analysis of PD and Control Samples: Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping on 106 PD patients and 74 control subjects was performed on whole blood DNA samples extracted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) using the Illumina NeuroX array. A total of 269,476 variants were genotyped, and the Genotyping Analysis Module within Genome Studio version 1.9.4 was used to call participant genotypes. We specifically extracted the DβH SNP data from the NINDS NeuroX genotyping data. 

A TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay, designed against the rs6271 SNP, was utilized to assess the genotype at amino acid position 549 (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). TaqMan assays were conducted using the OpenArray platform on a QuantStudio 12K Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific; formerly Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Twenty nanograms of genomic DNA was amplified per the manufacturer's directions scaled to a total volume of 5μL in an Applied Biosystems® Veriti® 384-well thermal cycler
